hello everybody dr yu here again withthe next video from the calgary guidevideo series diabetic ketoacidosis thisis not something you want to see in anemergency room when you're a physicianso let's get started learning about thepathophysiology and the clinical signsand symptoms as they relate to thepathophysiology to help you be morecomfortable when the situation comes upfor you inevitably in the futureplease help us reach more viewers byliking the video just as it's startingout and by subscribing to my channel solet's get starteddiabetic ketoacidosis is one of thecomplications of diabetes mellitus mostcommonly type 1 diabetes mellitusit's caused by infection or anothermetabolic demand which increases thebody's need for insulin but since type 1diabetes involves no insulin productionif no insulin is administeredtherapeutically then that triggers theprocess of diabetic ketoacidosis nowthese metabolic demands that contributeto dka can include a number of causesand you may have heard of them as theseven eyes pneumonic they includeinfection such as pneumonia orappendicitis or urinary tract infectionor sepsisinfarction such as myocardial infarctionor a strokeiatrogenic which is a change in theinsulin dose by the physician or by thepatient insulin which is the patient nottaking enough insulin or not taking anyinsulin intoxication such as withalcohol or illegal drugsincision such as surgery which can alsobe a triggering cause of dka and initialkids oftentimes present in dka as theirpresenting sign of type 1 diabetes nowbecause we have an absolute insulindeficit where no insulin is produced andno insulin is administered that leads totwo main effects effects because of thelack of insulin and effects because ofthe high blood sugar levels in the bodylet's talk about the lack of insulinfirst because there isn't any insulin inthe body to suppress lipolysis rememberinsulin is a anabolic hormone not acatabolic hormone that results in thebody to start actually producing energyfrom triglycerides after all there's notenough insulin in the body for thebody's cells to actually use the sugarin the bloodso the process of lipolysis begins withthe release of free fatty acids fromadipose tissue the free fatty acids arethen hydrolyzed in the liver in aprocess called ketogenesis theacetyl-coa is used as energy by thestarving cell and then the ketone bodiesare what is produced that act as energymolecules for the rest of the body theseketone bodies include chemicals such asbeta-hydroxybutyrateand acetoacetate they're formed and theyaccumulate in the blood now why are theyformed well because of the way thatneurons metabolizeketone bodies are the only other energymolecule besides glucose that neurons inthe brain can use so the body willproduce ketone bodies as a source ofenergy for the brain whenever itperceives being low on glucose theseacidic ketone bodies will get filteredout by the kidneys into the urineresulting in keto urea which canactually be detected on a urine dip nowbecause these ketone bodies are acidicthey also contribute to metabolicacidosis a high anion gap acidificationof the blood it's a high anion gapacidosis because ketoacids consume serumbicarbonate remember that the anion gapis a mathematical construct calculatedby subtracting the amount of bicarb andthe amount of chloride from the amountof sodium in the body because ketoacidsconsume bicarb that will increase thecalculated anion gap for the patient theincreased acidification of the blood hasa number of effects on the body firstacidosis disrupts the enteric nervoussystem which reduces gastric emptyingpotentially even causing an alias thatwill cause abdominal pain nauseavomiting which in turn will worsen thedehydration that's part of diabeticketoacidosis we'll get into that in aminute the body will reflexivelycompensate by trying to blow off carbondioxide remember that carbon dioxide isacidic and so breathing off more of itwill offset the acidosis that willresult in a characteristic pattern ofbreathing for patients with diabeticketoacidosis known as cousmalrespiration a deep and fast breathingpatternas the patient is breathing they'll bebreathing off the ketones that is intheir blood and because ketones have adistinctive odor which tends to be quitefruity in nature they have thischaracteristic ketone breath and finallyacidosis disrupts electrical signalingin the brain spinal cord and nerves thatwill lead to weakness confusion and orcoma in a serious dka patientnow let's talk about the effects thatare caused by hyperglycemiafrom the glucose that's remaining in theblood and not being taken up by themuscle and fat cells because of the lackof insulin to stimulate the muscle andfat cells that take it upthe lack of glucose inside body cellssuch as hypothalamic cells causes thehypothalamic cells to sense the lowintracellular glucoseand trigger feelings of hunger in thebody through complicated mechanismsthat will result in a sign known aspolyphagia a patient's desperate seekingout of foodcells starved of glucose also triggersan increased release of catabolichormones hormones that break downcomplex molecules into simpler ones forthe body to use these hormones includeglucagon epinephrine cortisol and growthhormonecollectively they are known as thecounter-regulatory hormonesthe result of these hormones is that thebody will try to increase blood glucoseconcentration to hopefully increase cellglucose absorptionpart of this involves reduced proteinsynthesis and increased proteolysis inthe muscle in order to produce moresubstrates for gluconeogenesis in theliver and in the liver there's increasedgluconeogenesis the production of moreglucose molecules and increasedglycogenolysis the destruction ofglycogen in order to produce moreglucose this paradoxically worsens thehyperglycemic state in the body if theblood sugar level reaches over 12millimoles per liter more glucose isfiltered out than can be reabsorbed bythe entire tubules of the kidney whichwill increase the urine glucoseconcentration to a detectable levelknown as glucosuria glucose in the urinefiltrate also promotes osmotic diuresisremember that water will move down itsosmotic gradient across any membrane ifthe concentration of solutes is higheron one side then water will move towardsthat side down its osmotic gradient thisis the case herewater will move into the kidney tubulesfrom the interstitial tissues of thekidney resulting in large volume urineoutput known as polyureaand because the patient is peeing outlarge volumes of fluid without consumingequally large amounts of water thatresults in severe dehydration andpatients can be dry up to four to fiveliters that will result incharacteristic signs of dehydrationsuch as the reduced jugular venous pulsejvp signs of orthostatic hypotensionpostural tachycardia and increasedresting heart rate remember thatpostural hypotension is a difference ofover 20 millimeters of mercury systolicblood pressure when going from lying tostanding after a minute and posturaltachycardia means an increase in heartrate of over 30 beats per minute whengoing from lying to standing after aminute the dehydration will of coursereduce the extracellular fluid volumewhich concentrates ketone bodies andexacerbates the acidosis that worsensall the clinical signs and symptoms ofmetabolic acidosis the dehydration willalso cause issues of its own lack offluid reduces blood flow to the brainspinal cord and nerves which will againworsen weakness confusion and leading toa possible coma if the patient is alertand water is still accessible thepatient will respond by drinking heavilynot alcohol water and this sign is knownas polydipsia and finally dehydrationcan of course alter the total body waterand ion concentrations leading toelectrolyte imbalance one criticalelectrolyte in dka management ispotassium in dka body potassium is lostvia osmotic diuresis and vomiting butthe body compensates for this reducedserum potassium concentration becausepotassium will diffuse out of body cellsinto the blood this results in apossibly falsely normal or even falselyelevated potassium concentration asmeasured in the serum this is whytreating dka also involves giving ivpotassium chloride along with the ivinsulin as soon as the serum potassiumreaches less than 5.0 millimoles perliter because of the goal to preventhypokalemia but of course we need totreat the dehydration first so to treatdka we first give plenty of fluids ivwe then give insulin and or potassiumand then we follow the anion gap untilit closes to know when to stop givinginsulin we then treat the underlyingcause once the patient has beenresuscitated finally we treat the lowphosphate levels which typically occursa few hours to a day after the ketosisresolves because of increased atpproductionand that's all for diabetic ketoacidosisif you enjoyed our overview of thistopic and now have a betterunderstanding of just how and why thesigns and symptoms of dka are what theyare please give this video a like andsubscribe to my channel and if you'reinterested in more on the topic
