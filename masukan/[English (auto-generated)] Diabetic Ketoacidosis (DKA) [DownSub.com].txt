hello everybody dr yu here again with

the next video from the calgary guide

video series diabetic ketoacidosis this

is not something you want to see in an

emergency room when you're a physician

so let's get started learning about the

pathophysiology and the clinical signs

and symptoms as they relate to the

pathophysiology to help you be more

comfortable when the situation comes up

for you inevitably in the future

please help us reach more viewers by

liking the video just as it's starting

out and by subscribing to my channel so

let's get started

diabetic ketoacidosis is one of the

complications of diabetes mellitus most

commonly type 1 diabetes mellitus

it's caused by infection or another

metabolic demand which increases the

body's need for insulin but since type 1

diabetes involves no insulin production

if no insulin is administered

therapeutically then that triggers the

process of diabetic ketoacidosis now

these metabolic demands that contribute

to dka can include a number of causes

and you may have heard of them as the

seven eyes pneumonic they include

infection such as pneumonia or

appendicitis or urinary tract infection

or sepsis

infarction such as myocardial infarction

or a stroke

iatrogenic which is a change in the

insulin dose by the physician or by the

patient insulin which is the patient not

taking enough insulin or not taking any

insulin intoxication such as with

alcohol or illegal drugs

incision such as surgery which can also

be a triggering cause of dka and initial

kids oftentimes present in dka as their

presenting sign of type 1 diabetes now

because we have an absolute insulin

deficit where no insulin is produced and

no insulin is administered that leads to

two main effects effects because of the

lack of insulin and effects because of

the high blood sugar levels in the body

let's talk about the lack of insulin

first because there isn't any insulin in

the body to suppress lipolysis remember

insulin is a anabolic hormone not a

catabolic hormone that results in the

body to start actually producing energy

from triglycerides after all there's not

enough insulin in the body for the

body's cells to actually use the sugar

in the blood

so the process of lipolysis begins with

the release of free fatty acids from

adipose tissue the free fatty acids are

then hydrolyzed in the liver in a

process called ketogenesis the

acetyl-coa is used as energy by the

starving cell and then the ketone bodies

are what is produced that act as energy

molecules for the rest of the body these

ketone bodies include chemicals such as

beta-hydroxybutyrate

and acetoacetate they're formed and they

accumulate in the blood now why are they

formed well because of the way that

neurons metabolize

ketone bodies are the only other energy

molecule besides glucose that neurons in

the brain can use so the body will

produce ketone bodies as a source of

energy for the brain whenever it

perceives being low on glucose these

acidic ketone bodies will get filtered

out by the kidneys into the urine

resulting in keto urea which can

actually be detected on a urine dip now

because these ketone bodies are acidic

they also contribute to metabolic

acidosis a high anion gap acidification

of the blood it's a high anion gap

acidosis because ketoacids consume serum

bicarbonate remember that the anion gap

is a mathematical construct calculated

by subtracting the amount of bicarb and

the amount of chloride from the amount

of sodium in the body because ketoacids

consume bicarb that will increase the

calculated anion gap for the patient the

increased acidification of the blood has

a number of effects on the body first

acidosis disrupts the enteric nervous

system which reduces gastric emptying

potentially even causing an alias that

will cause abdominal pain nausea

vomiting which in turn will worsen the

dehydration that's part of diabetic

ketoacidosis we'll get into that in a

minute the body will reflexively

compensate by trying to blow off carbon

dioxide remember that carbon dioxide is

acidic and so breathing off more of it

will offset the acidosis that will

result in a characteristic pattern of

breathing for patients with diabetic

ketoacidosis known as cousmal

respiration a deep and fast breathing

pattern

as the patient is breathing they'll be

breathing off the ketones that is in

their blood and because ketones have a

distinctive odor which tends to be quite

fruity in nature they have this

characteristic ketone breath and finally

acidosis disrupts electrical signaling

in the brain spinal cord and nerves that

will lead to weakness confusion and or

coma in a serious dka patient

now let's talk about the effects that

are caused by hyperglycemia

from the glucose that's remaining in the

blood and not being taken up by the

muscle and fat cells because of the lack

of insulin to stimulate the muscle and

fat cells that take it up

the lack of glucose inside body cells

such as hypothalamic cells causes the

hypothalamic cells to sense the low

intracellular glucose

and trigger feelings of hunger in the

body through complicated mechanisms

that will result in a sign known as

polyphagia a patient's desperate seeking

out of food

cells starved of glucose also triggers

an increased release of catabolic

hormones hormones that break down

complex molecules into simpler ones for

the body to use these hormones include

glucagon epinephrine cortisol and growth

hormone

collectively they are known as the

counter-regulatory hormones

the result of these hormones is that the

body will try to increase blood glucose

concentration to hopefully increase cell

glucose absorption

part of this involves reduced protein

synthesis and increased proteolysis in

the muscle in order to produce more

substrates for gluconeogenesis in the

liver and in the liver there's increased

gluconeogenesis the production of more

glucose molecules and increased

glycogenolysis the destruction of

glycogen in order to produce more

glucose this paradoxically worsens the

hyperglycemic state in the body if the

blood sugar level reaches over 12

millimoles per liter more glucose is

filtered out than can be reabsorbed by

the entire tubules of the kidney which

will increase the urine glucose

concentration to a detectable level

known as glucosuria glucose in the urine

filtrate also promotes osmotic diuresis

remember that water will move down its

osmotic gradient across any membrane if

the concentration of solutes is higher

on one side then water will move towards

that side down its osmotic gradient this

is the case here

water will move into the kidney tubules

from the interstitial tissues of the

kidney resulting in large volume urine

output known as polyurea

and because the patient is peeing out

large volumes of fluid without consuming

equally large amounts of water that

results in severe dehydration and

patients can be dry up to four to five

liters that will result in

characteristic signs of dehydration

such as the reduced jugular venous pulse

jvp signs of orthostatic hypotension

postural tachycardia and increased

resting heart rate remember that

postural hypotension is a difference of

over 20 millimeters of mercury systolic

blood pressure when going from lying to

standing after a minute and postural

tachycardia means an increase in heart

rate of over 30 beats per minute when

going from lying to standing after a

minute the dehydration will of course

reduce the extracellular fluid volume

which concentrates ketone bodies and

exacerbates the acidosis that worsens

all the clinical signs and symptoms of

metabolic acidosis the dehydration will

also cause issues of its own lack of

fluid reduces blood flow to the brain

spinal cord and nerves which will again

worsen weakness confusion and leading to

a possible coma if the patient is alert

and water is still accessible the

patient will respond by drinking heavily

not alcohol water and this sign is known

as polydipsia and finally dehydration

can of course alter the total body water

and ion concentrations leading to

electrolyte imbalance one critical

electrolyte in dka management is

potassium in dka body potassium is lost

via osmotic diuresis and vomiting but

the body compensates for this reduced

serum potassium concentration because

potassium will diffuse out of body cells

into the blood this results in a

possibly falsely normal or even falsely

elevated potassium concentration as

measured in the serum this is why

treating dka also involves giving iv

potassium chloride along with the iv

insulin as soon as the serum potassium

reaches less than 5.0 millimoles per

liter because of the goal to prevent

hypokalemia but of course we need to

treat the dehydration first so to treat

dka we first give plenty of fluids iv

we then give insulin and or potassium

and then we follow the anion gap until

it closes to know when to stop giving

insulin we then treat the underlying

cause once the patient has been

resuscitated finally we treat the low

phosphate levels which typically occurs

a few hours to a day after the ketosis

resolves because of increased atp

production

and that's all for diabetic ketoacidosis
